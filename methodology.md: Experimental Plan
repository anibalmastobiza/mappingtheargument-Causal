Research Design Overview

This study employs a within-subjects experimental design to measure the effect of causal language density on a reader's ability to accurately construct a causal model of a text. The experiment is implemented as an interactive web application designed for deployment on GitHub Pages and data collection via Prolific.
Causal Effect of Interest (Estimand)

The primary estimand is the difference in causal map accuracy between the high-density and low-density causal language conditions. Secondary estimands include differences in task completion time, subjective clarity, and cognitive load.
Hypotheses

    Accuracy Hypothesis (H1): Participants will construct more accurate causal maps (i.e., maps that more closely match the ground-truth structure of the abstract) after reading abstracts with low-density causal language compared to those with high-density language.

    Cognitive Load Hypothesis (H2): The causal mapping task will take longer to complete and will be rated as requiring higher cognitive load for the high-density abstracts.

    Clarity Hypothesis (H3): Participants will rate the low-density abstracts as clearer and will report higher confidence in their constructed maps for that condition.

Experimental Design

    Design: Within-subjects (repeated measures).

    Independent Variable: Causal Language Density (2 levels: High, Low).

    Counterbalancing: The order of presentation of the high- and low-density abstracts will be counterbalanced across participants.

    Dependent Variables:

        Causal Map Accuracy (Objective): Measured as the structural similarity (e.g., F1 score on adjacency matrices) between the participant's drawn graph and the abstract's pre-defined ground-truth graph.

        Task Completion Time (Objective): Time in seconds from the presentation of the mapping interface to submission.

        Clarity Rating (Subjective): 7-point Likert scale (1=Very Unclear, 7=Very Clear).

        Cognitive Load Rating (Subjective): 7-point Likert scale (1=Very Low Effort, 7=Very High Effort).

Statistical Analysis Plan

    Primary Analyses: A series of paired-samples t-tests will be conducted to compare the dependent variables (Accuracy, Completion Time, Clarity, Cognitive Load) between the High and Low density conditions.

    Effect Sizes: Cohen's dz will be calculated for each comparison to estimate effect magnitudes.

Open Science Practices

    Pre-registration: The hypotheses, design, and analysis plan will be pre-registered on AsPredicted or OSF prior to data collection.

    Open Materials: The interactive experiment, stimuli, and methodology will be publicly available in this GitHub repository.

    Open Data: Anonymized data (participant-generated graphs and survey responses) will be shared on a public repository (e.g., OSF) upon publication.
