Interactive Causal Mapping Study
Project Overview

This project investigates how the density of causal language in philosophical abstracts affects a reader's ability to accurately comprehend and represent the author's intended causal model.

Inspired by Causal Network Elicitation Tasks (CNET), this study moves beyond subjective ratings to an interactive paradigm. Participants read philosophical abstracts with either high or low densities of causal terms and then visually construct a causal map of the relationships described in the text.

The primary goal is to measure the accuracy of the constructed causal maps as an objective proxy for comprehension, alongside subjective measures of cognitive load and clarity. This experiment is designed for deployment on GitHub Pages and data collection via the Prolific platform.
